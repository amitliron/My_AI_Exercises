1. run with the following environment: /home/amitli/OrYair/orYairVenv
2. The following commands:
   %load_ext autoreload
   %autoreload 2
   
   helps us to install new pip packages without restart kernerl (Auto reload the new packages)
   
3. when running the notebook code from pycharm -> .to(Device) get stuck. I didn't found any answer.

4. In 'Age prediction' I have tried to use regression model:
   4.1 The model last layer is one tensor
   4.2 (Epoc code):
       We compare y with xHat, 
       xHat is float so we need to convert y to float (like we comape 2 images in AE):
       vY = vY.type(torch.FloatTensor)
   4.3 (Epoc code):
       we get (batch_size, 1) and in order to run LOSS function we need to ignore the '1' dim:
       mZ   = mZ.squeeze() 
   
   
5. When using ImageFolder (in order to load folder with sub folder images)
   the tags starts from 0 
   (if the folder names start from 20/ 21/ 22/ ... => 0,1,2...)   
   
6.  ImageFolder loads images as (3, 128, 128), in order to show then we need to premute them (128, 128, 3)

7. If think we got bad results becuase:
   7.1 resolution too low (128,128,3)
   7.2 (maybe outliers) but: persons may look older or younger
   
8. Use SHAP and resnet50:
   According to:
   https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/1479
   there is a bug: "if a layer is reused (such as activation ReLU), deep pytorch deletes the previous input/outputs of the module and replaces it with new input outputs where the activation is reused."
