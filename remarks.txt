1. run with the following environment: /home/amitli/OrYair/orYairVenv
2. The following commands:
   %load_ext autoreload
   %autoreload 2
   
   helps us to install new pip packages without restart kernerl (Auto reload the new packages)
   
3. when running the notebook code from pycharm -> .to(Device) get stuck. I didn't found any answer.

4. In 'Age prediction' I have tried to use regression model:
   4.1 The model last layer is one tensor
   4.2 (Epoc code):
       We compare y with xHat, 
       xHat is float so we need to convert y to float (like we comape 2 images in AE):
       vY = vY.type(torch.FloatTensor)
   4.3 (Epoc code):
       we get (batch_size, 1) and in order to run LOSS function we need to ignore the '1' dim:
       mZ   = mZ.squeeze() 
   
   
5. When using ImageFolder (in order to load folder with sub folder images)
   the tags starts from 0 
   (if the folder names start from 20/ 21/ 22/ ... => 0,1,2...)
